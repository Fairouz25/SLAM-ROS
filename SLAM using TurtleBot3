To do Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using ROS you should follow these few steps:

1- Type "source devel/setup.bash" then type "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi".
  The model can be burger,waffle or waffle_pi. In my case it is waffle_pi.
  
2- Open an empty space that contains the turtlebot3 by typing this command
  "roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch" in the root of the workspace,
  then insert a 'home' (or any other shape) inside this space to be like the image "house.png".
  
3- Open new terminal and type "source devel/setup.bash" then type "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi",
  then type "roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping".

4- To move the robot type in new terminal "source devel/setup.bash" then type "export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi",
  after that type "roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch".
  After moving the robot in all direction inside this space you should have image like "house_map.png".
  
5- After these steps you can extract and save the map by typing this command 
  "rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map", and you will get a map like "map.pgm".

*Note: If you have a problem with the "gmapping", you can type this command 
      "git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git" 
      inside the 'src' folder that is inside the workspace.
